## DESCRIPTION
For this analysis, we utilized an api to gather the real estate data from https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/unofficial-redfin/

We chose to examine real estate data from the popular site redfin. Our initial interest was to particularly examine real estate prices in large tech cities to compare with the nation's average.

Information included on the final includes:
- A graph of price by time on market
- A leaflet map with pins showing location of the homes
- A list of facts about the chosen city which includes:
    - Median Price compared with the National Average
    - Mean Price
    - Mean Beds 
    - Mean Baths
    - Mean sqft
